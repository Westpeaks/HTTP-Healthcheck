# Parse YAML File and Check the Health of HTTP Endpoints

## A fully functional script that parses a yaml file for multiple HTTP endpoints and then performs a series of HTTP requests to verify if the site is up and responds to requests.

This script was built as a coding challenge demonstrating how to parse a yaml file, extract URLs from the file, and run a series of HTTP requests to check, analyze, and verify the health (availability of access) of a prticular site.
